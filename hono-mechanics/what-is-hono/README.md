# What is HONO?

HONO is an algorithmic rebase token fully backed by wstETH, with its supply managed through a minting and redeeming system known as the Comprehensive Harmonizer for Arbitrage Kinetics and Revenue Accumulation (CHAKRA).

This mechanism enables HONO to steadily appreciate in value relative to ETH, targeting an average annual growth rate of 8â€“25% regardless of market conditions.

NOTE: However, as the number of tokens in circulation increases, the rate of price appreciation is expected to gradually slow down over time.
