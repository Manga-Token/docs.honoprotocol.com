## The HONO Vault

The HONO vault serves as the foundation for the HONO token, anchoring all transactions associated with the platform. It ensures stability and growth, making it a crucial element of the protocol’s structure.

With the launch of HONO V2, the vault’s backing asset was upgraded to wstETH, enhancing its yield-generating capacity and aligning with the protocol’s commitment to sustainable growth.

The vault collects a portion of the fees from each transaction across all revenue-generating activities within the ecosystem. As these transactions increase, the vault’s value grows, which, in turn, supports the appreciation of HONO.

This structure means that the value of the vault, denominated in wstETH and excluding circulating HONO, will only continue to rise. This mechanism enables HONO to scale its value sustainably as a function of total platform transaction volume.
