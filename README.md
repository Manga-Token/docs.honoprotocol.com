# HONO Protocol

## **What is HONO Protocol?**

The HONO Protocol is a decentralized financial infrastructure designed to provide scalable growth liquidity on decentralized exchanges (DEXs). Powered by its native rebase token, HONO, the protocol is fully backed by yield-bearing assets, primarily wrapped staked ETH (wstETH). HONO uses an algorithmic elastic supply that adjusts based on revenue accumulation, ensuring consistent value growth.

At the core of the protocol are diverse community businesses that generate revenue to sustain HONO’s long-term growth and stability. Additionally, HONO serves as a unique liquidity pair on Uniswap, enhancing the tradability of other ERC20 tokens, and provides a robust backing for new rebasing assets to increase their market appeal. Users can participate by holding HONO to benefit from value appreciation or staking liquidity on Uniswap to earn a share of the protocol’s income.

Through xHONO, the governance token of HONO Protocol, users can engage in protocol decision-making, directing emissions to different revenue pools and shaping the ecosystem's growth trajectory.
