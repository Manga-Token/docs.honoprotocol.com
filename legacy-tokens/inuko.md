## What is INUKO Coin?

INUKO Coin was launched as a meme coin on the BNB Chain in May 2023.

### **Objective of INUKO Finance**

INUKO Finance aimed to create a marketplace where project teams could raise funds by selling reserved tokens without affecting the overall market price. This was made possible with a Dutch Auction system, where prices gradually drop until a token purchase is made, at which point the price resets and starts adjusting again.

### **Decommissioning of INUKO**

INUKO will no longer be supported from December 2024 onwards.

### **INUKO Contract Address**

The official INUKO contract address is: [0xEa51801b8F5B88543DdaD3D1727400c15b209D8f](https://bscscan.com/token/0xea51801b8f5b88543ddad3d1727400c15b209d8f). Holders are advised to verify this address for any transactions or conversions.

### **Converting INUKO to xHONO**

Current INUKO holders are encouraged to convert their INUKO tokens to xHONO to continue benefiting from the platform. For full instructions, please see the [INUKO to xHONO Conversion Guide](../xhono-token/how-to-get-xhono/inuko-greater-than-xhono.md).
