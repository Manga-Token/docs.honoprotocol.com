These HONO Protocol Terms of Use (together with all appendices and exhibits hereto, which are hereby incorporated by reference, these “Terms,” “Terms of Use,” or this “Agreement”) explain the terms and conditions by which you, whether personally or on behalf of an entity (“you”), may access and use the software products and services (the “Services”) provided by HONO Protocol (hereinafter referred to as “HONO Protocol” “we,” “us,” and “our”) to interact with the non-custodial, blockchain-based software protocol known as the “HONO Protocol,” as described below. The Services shall include, but shall not necessarily be limited to, the website, https://honoprotocol.com (the “Website”), and https://app.honoprotocol.com, a website-hosted user interface, as well as any other websites, apps, interfaces or dashboards, available through the honoprotocol.com domain, its subdomains, or any other means (the “Interface” or “Web App”). Please read these Terms of Use carefully as they govern your use of the Services.

### **You Are Entering Into a Binding Agreement**

**By accessing, using or interacting with the Services in any way, including by connecting your digital wallet address to the Interface, you represent that you have read, understand, acknowledge, and agree that you are entering into a binding legal agreement with us that includes these Terms and the Privacy Policy in their entirety. If you do not agree to be bound, you are not authorized to access, and should not use, any of the Services.**

### **Technical Services Only**

**THE SERVICES INCLUDE TECHNICAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE SERVICES THAT MAKE IT POSSIBLE FOR USERS TO ACCESS AND INTERACT WITH ON CHAIN SMART CONTRACTS THAT FUNCTION DETERMINISTICALLY AND ARE NOT OPERATED OR CONTROLLED BY HONO PROTOCOL, AND INCLUDE, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE INTERFACE, WHICH ALLOWS USERS TO DIRECTLY INTERACT WITH THE FULLY NON CUSTODIAL, DECENTRALIZED SOFTWARE PROTOCOL, KNOWN AS THE “HONO PROTOCOL,” WHICH OPERATES ON A PERMISSIONLESS PUBLIC BLOCKCHAIN, AS WELL AS OTHER SIMILAR PROTOCOLS. THE SERVICES ARE DISTINCT FROM THE HONO PROTOCOL AND PROVIDE ONE, BUT NOT THE EXCLUSIVE, MEANS OF ACCESSING THE HONO PROTOCOL. THE HONO PROTOCOL CONSISTS OF OPEN SOURCE, SELF EXECUTING, AUTONOMOUS SMART CONTRACTS THAT ARE DEPLOYED ON THE ETHEREUM BLOCKCHAIN. HONO PROTOCOL IS NOT A BROKER, DEALER, EXCHANGE, INVESTMENT ADVISER, CUSTODIAN OR FINANCIAL SERVICE PROVIDER OF ANY KIND. WE DO NOT HAVE A FIDUCIARY RELATIONSHIP OR OBLIGATION TO YOU IN CONNECTION WITH ANY OF THE SERVICES.**

### **Binding Arbitration; Class Action and Jury Trial Waiver**

**PLEASE BE AWARE THAT SECTION 5 GOVERNS THE RESOLUTION OF DISPUTES**

**BETWEEN YOU AND US. SECTION 5 INCLUDES AN AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE, WHICH REQUIRES, WITH LIMITED EXCEPTIONS, THAT ALL DISPUTES BETWEEN YOU AND US SHALL BE RESOLVED BY BINDING AND FINAL ARBITRATION.**

**SECTION 5 ALSO CONTAINS A CLASS ACTION AND JURY TRIAL WAIVER. PLEASE READ SECTION 5 CAREFULLY.**

### **Amendment of These Terms**

We reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to amend or modify these Terms at any time. If and when we make changes, we will provide you with notice of such changes by updating the date reflected at the top of these Terms. All amendments will be effective when they are posted, and your continued use of the Services thereafter will constitute your acceptance of such revised Terms. If you do not agree with any such amendment, you must immediately stop accessing the Interface and terminate your use of the Services.

### **1. The Services**

#### **1.1 The Interface**

The Interface provides both web and mobile access to the fully non-custodial, blockchain-based software protocol known as the “HONO Protocol,” which operates on the Ethereum blockchain, and may extend to several Ethereum Layer 2 solutions in the future. The Interface is distinct from the HONO Protocol and is one, but not the exclusive, means of accessing the HONO Protocol. The HONO Protocol consists of open-source, self-executing, autonomous smart contracts that are currently deployed on the Ethereum blockchain. You may access the Interface via your non-custodial digital wallet, which allows you to directly interact with public blockchains. Your use of a non-custodial digital wallet is governed by the applicable terms of service of the third-party digital wallet provider.

New versions and upgrades to the HONO Protocol may be released from time to time, subject to the independent governance rules of the HONO Protocol. The Services may not be compatible with prior, abandoned or outdated versions of the HONOProtocol. HONO Protcol undertakes no responsibility or obligation to update or maintain the Interface to support legacy versions of the HONO Protocol. The Services may also become degraded or unexpectedly unavailable at times. To the extent you are using the Services to interact with the HONO Protocol, this could result in delays in accessing the HONO Protocol and your funds. We assume no responsibility or liability for any loss of, or delayed access to, your funds or otherwise delayed or failed transactions arising out of or in connection with any such degradation or unavailability of the Services.

#### **1.2 Availability of Third-Party Products and Services**

We reserve the right to make certain third-party products and services available to you through API integrations with third-party providers or blockchain-based integrations. Any such third-party products and services may include integrations, links, or other access to third-party services, sites, technology, content, and resources. By choosing to use these third-party products and services, you acknowledge and agree that your use of such products and services is subject to any terms and conditions, privacy policies, and other applicable agreements of the respective third-party providers. It is your responsibility to review and understand these terms before utilizing any third-party products and services available through the Interface. We disclaim any liability for any issues arising from your use of these third-party products and services, including, but not limited to, any breach of contract, privacy, or data security issues. You, and not HONO Protcol will be responsible for any and all fees and charges associated with your use of any thirdparty services. HONO Protocol enables access to these third-party services merely as a convenience, and the inclusion of a third-party service on the Interface does not constitute an endorsement or recommendation of that third partyʼs products and services. Any dealings that you have with third parties while using the Services, such as the Interface, are between you and that third party. HONO Protocol will not be responsible or liable, directly or indirectly, for any damage or loss caused or alleged to be caused, by or in connection with the use of or reliance on any third-party products and services. HONO Protocol has no control over, and is not responsible for the accuracy, reliability, or completeness of such third-party products and services. We encourage you to review the terms of use and privacy policies of the third-party providers prior to using such products and services. Some third-party products or services will provide us with access to certain information that you have provided to such parties through your use of the third-party services, and we will use, store, and disclose such information in accordance with our Privacy Policy. For more information on the implications of using any products and services made available via the Services through thirdparty integrations or otherwise, including our use, storage, and disclosure of information related to you and your use of such third-party services within the Services, please see our Privacy Policy.

#### **1.3 Other Products and Services**

We may, from time to time, in the future offer to you additional products and services. Such products and services shall be considered part of the Services, irrespective of whether such product is specifically defined in these Terms.

#### **1.4 Modifications of the Services**

We reserve the right, in our sole discretion, and without any liability to you, to modify, substitute, eliminate, add, or discontinue all or part of any of the Services at any time, including access to products and services made available via any thirdparty API integrations or links or blockchain-based integrations. We further reserve the right to review, modify, filter, disable, delete, and remove any and all content and information from any of the Services at any time, and without any liability to you.

#### **1.5 Informational Resources**

We may also make certain informational resources relating to the HONO Protocol, including, without limitation, the documentation on the Website, blog posts, data, articles, tutorials, social media posts and other informational content published by us, our employees or marketing partners (“**Informational Resources**”), available to you as part of the Services. The Informational Resources provided are not exhaustive and may not cover all aspects of or potential developments concerning the HONO Protocol. You acknowledge and agree that all such Informational Resources are intended for informational and educational purposes only and are not the exclusive or sole source of information regarding the HONO Protocol. HONO Protocol shall not be responsible or liable for any damage or loss caused or alleged to be caused by or in connection with the use or reliance on any

Informational Resources. We assume no responsibility for keeping the Informational Resources up to date and/or accurate.

#### **1.6 User Control of Cryptoassets**

You understand, acknowledge and agree that neither we, nor any of our affiliates, are party to any transaction on the HONO Protocol. We do not retain possession, custody, or control over any user cryptoassets at any time. Due to the decentralized, non-custodial nature of the HONO Protocol, HONO Protocol users retain exclusive control over their cryptoassets at all times. You are solely responsible for safeguarding your private keys to your digital wallet/s, and you should never share your wallet credentials or seed phrase with anyone. We accept no responsibility for, or liability to you, in connection with your use of a digital wallet, and we make no representations or warranties regarding how any of the Services will operate with any type of digital wallet. Further, we accept no liability for any acts or omissions by you in connection with, or as a result of, your digital wallet being compromised.

These Terms are not intended to, and do not, create or impose any fiduciary duties on us. To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, you understand, acknowledge, and agree that we owe no fiduciary duties or liabilities to you or any other party, and to the extent that any such duties or liabilities may exist at law or in equity, those duties and liabilities are hereby irrevocably disclaimed, waived, and eliminated. You further agree that the only duties and obligations that we owe to you are those expressly set forth in these Terms.

#### **1.7 Transaction Fees**

Blockchain transactions, including transactions occurring through the HONO Protocol, may require the payment of network transaction fees (i.e., gas fees). You will be solely responsible to pay the gas fees for any transaction that you initiate via any of the Services or through a third-party integration. You will also be responsible for any service or transaction fees assessed by, or in connection with your use of, the HONO Protocol, which may be updated from time to time in accordance with the governance construct of the HONO Protocol.

#### **1.8 Tax Compliance**

Your use of the Services, such as the Interface, to access the HONO Protocol, may result in various tax obligations or consequences, such as income or capital gains tax. It is your responsibility to determine whether taxes apply to any transactions that you initiate or receive, and, if so, to report and/or remit the correct tax amount to the appropriate tax authority.

If there is any inconsistency between any term of the CI MAC Rules and any term of this Arbitration Agreement, the applicable terms of this Arbitration Agreement will control unless the arbitrator determines that the application of the inconsistent Arbitration Agreement terms would not result in a fundamentally fair arbitration. The arbitrator must also follow the provisions of these Terms as a court would.
